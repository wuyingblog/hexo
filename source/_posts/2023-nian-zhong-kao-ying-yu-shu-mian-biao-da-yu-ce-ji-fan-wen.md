Last week,I went to the science and technology museum.I was greatly interested in a new kind of robot Home Doctor.

Home Doctor was invented two months ago.And it was invented by three young men.It looks like a lovely girl,and it is about 1.2 meters tall.It is made from recycled materials,like glass and plastic.Home Doctor can not only give people lots of advice on health,but also treat common diseases at home.It will save people a lot of time,because they needn't go to the hospital whenever they feel sick or get hurt.What's more,it can help take good care of the old people and babies at home.

I believe Home Doctor will be very popular with people in the future.

Hello,everyone！My name is Li Hua.Nowadays, people care more about our grades. In fact,good behavior is as important as good grades.However,some bad behavior can be seen around us. For example,some students throw rubbish everywhere, which makes the environment worse and worse. Some students are always shouting back angrily to their parents.Gradually,the relations between them have become difficult.

How can we behave well? First,I think we should be polite and kind to others.Be ready to help others in need.Second,try to be honest and keep promises. The most important thing is to follow the rules at school or in public.

Let's pull together and take action from now on. I believe we'll be better students as long as we behave ourselves.

That's all.Thanks for listening!

Nowadays, many people prefer ordering food online.Some people think it’s good to order food online. It is more convenient and faster than we cook at home, so we can save much time to do other things. Besides, there are many kinds of take-away food and most of them are delicious.What’s more, ordering food online can reduce going out and avoid risks.

However, other people hold a different opinion.They say some restaurants may have food safety problems and plastic packages are bad for our environment and health. In addition, this kind of eating habitis unhealthy.

In my opinion, we can order food online sometimes,but for the sake of our health, we’d better cook it by ourselves.

The results of the survey show that 17% of the students hardly ever practice speaking English. 45% of the students usually practice speaking English,38% of the students practice speaking English sometimes.How do you practice speaking English? Most students speak more only in class. Some of the students talk with friends in English.Some students practice speaking English in other ways.

In my opinion,we should talk with our partners in English as much as we can. Also,we should often listen to English stories in order to improve our understanding of English. Never be afraid of speaking English in front of others! This is quite important. Over and above,we should learn more English words. Only in this way can we be good English speakers!

Good morning, everyone! Since the “double reduction" policy was released, our lives have changed a lot.Next let me talk about it.

We used to do our homework till midnight and have no time for our hobbies.At the same time, we always attended many training courses at weekends. So we felt very tired all the time.

However, with the support of the "double reduction" policy, though we go home late, we have more interesting activities we like, like playing football and other ball games, learning playing the piano and violin, handwriting, drawing and so on. We feel very excited when we join in these activities. Moreover, we can have more time to communicate with our parents because we have little homework after school. And we can get on well with our teachers and classmates.

I believe we can study happily and have fun at school because of the "double reduction" policy.

Dear Jimmy,

You told me that you had some problems with your study and life. I'd like to give you some advice.

If you always feel stressed, I advise you to wear blue or white. They will make you feel relaxed.If you can't sleep well at night,you'd better paint the walls of your bedroom blue, as sleeping in a blue room will bring peace to both your mind and body. If you can't get good marks in exams, I think it's good for you to use yellow pens.Yellow is the colour of wisdom. Some people prefer this colour when they hope for success. If you feel unhappy, you can watch some comedies.They can make you laugh and forget annoyance.

I'm sure you will feel much better if you follow my advice.

Yours,

John

How to get over difficulty

In our daily life, we often meet different kinds of difficulties. But how can we get over them? Here is one of my experience.

When I was in Grade 7, I didn’t do well in my lessons first. Exams always brought me endless sadness. As a result, I was afraid of study and I became very lonely. I turned to my teachers for help, they gave me some useful advice. They told menot to give up because nothing is impossible for a willing heart. I was moved and worked harder and harder than before. Finally, I succeeded.

NowI understand that I should learn to get over difficulty by myself with confidence and hard work.

【范文赏析】

With the development of modern science and technology,robots have entered our life,which brings great convenience to us. Household robots which look modern and fashionable are very popular with people,and they are now widely used in our daily life.

Household robots have many functions. Firstly, they can be used to cook and clean rooms. Secondly, they can help to take care of the elderly. Moreover, they can even make calls to deal with something dangerous. However,the technology used in household robots is not developed well enough to solve all problems.And they are so expensive. Sometimes, they may catch viruses and cause safety problems.

In my opinion,robots should be widely used to improve people's life.Scientists should make robots much more perfect by developing the technology.
